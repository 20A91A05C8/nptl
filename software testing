# term "bug" or "fault" was first used by edison
# term "error" is first used by ada lovelace
types of testing:
----------------
   1.unit testing : done by a develpoer
   2.integration testing : software and hardware combination testing
   3.system testing : platform in which system is running
   4.acceptance testing : done by the custmor also called as beta testing,a beta version is released.
   5.functional testing : whether it meets all the functionalities
   6.stress testing : how much load can that software handel
   7.performance testing : to check speed
   8.usability testing : to evaluate user interface aesthtics
   9.regression testing : done after modifing or adding new features
Black box testing: dont check internal design,but checks functionalities[unit,integration,system,acceptance,usability,performance,beta,stress testing]
White box testing:checks internal design and functionalities[unit,integration,system testing]
Four activities of testing:
  1.test design
  2.test automation
  3.test execution
  4.test evaluation
test management ,test maintenance,test documantation
RIPR model(to observe failures)
  reachability:reach the fault
  infection:state of program must be incorrect
  propagation:infected must give some output to be incorrected
  reveal:tester should observe incorrected state
Model based testing
  1.formal,mathematical notation(finate state machine,graphs,logical formulas)
  2.language that supports several entities for modeling(uml,sysml,simulink,stateflow)
graphs,local expressions,sets,grammar
test requirements:a specific element of a software artifact that a test case must meet/cover
coverage criterion:a collection of rules that impose requirements on a set of testcase
junit: used in java for testing
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.*;
few premative models are:
      >assertTrue(boolen)
      >assertTrue(string,boolen)
      >fail(string)
